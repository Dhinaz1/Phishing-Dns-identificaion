Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to internet users' privacy, often resulting in the illicit acquisition of financial data through a blend of social engineering and spoofing techniques. Traditional blacklists frequently fall short in effectively identifying phishing sites due to their ephemeral nature. Consequently, heuristics have emerged as a promising avenue for detection. Numerous studies have explored various phishing characteristics to inform heuristic tests, comparing their effectiveness with that of blacklists. In this research, a novel approach to heuristics was taken. Leveraging insights from the attributes of phishing URLs and webpages, 20 heuristic tests were devised and seamlessly integrated into the exploration of XGradient Boost Tree for spam filtering development to advance spam filters. Subsequently, comprehensive evaluations were conducted to gauge the efficacy of these heuristics, pinpointing crucial factors pivotal in discerning legitimate websites from their phishing counterparts. The accuracy generated from the mentioned models is 97.53%.
